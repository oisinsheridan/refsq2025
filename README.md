# "Sharper Specs for Smarter Drones: Formalising Requirements with FRET" -- REFSQ 2025 Experience Report

Notes on the included files:

- During elicitation, each iteration of the FRETish requirements was referred to as “v0.X”, with X starting from 1 with the initial formalisation. These artefacts reflect this convention.
- Natural_Language_Requirements.xlsx contains the original set of 66 natural language requirements, along with metadata including categories for the requirements.
- FRETish_Drone_Requirements_Comparison.xlsx includes the natural language version of each requirement and each FRETish iteration, as well as all child requirements that were created during the elicitation process, organised to show how the requirements set evolved with each iteration.
    - A blank cell indicates that the requirement either had not been formalised yet, or was not updated from the previous FRETish iteration
    - This spreadsheet also includes some notes and comments on the requirements, in two categories: “Comment on v0.X” indicates comments notes on the formalisation of the requirement in that version, while “Discussion on v0.X” indicates notes taken from discussions after that version had been formalised.
- The folder FRET_JSONs contains JSON files for each iteration of the requirements set that can be used to import the requirements into FRET.
